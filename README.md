# Uninformed-Search-Algorithms
Given a list of points and their distances between each other we will find the shortest route possible by using two uninfomed search algorithms: breadth first search or BFS and depth first search or DFS. You will find the py file and a link to the google colab notebook if you want to see the code neatly presented
